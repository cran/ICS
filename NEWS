LOG of the CHANGES in the package ICS

Version 1.4-2

* commenting out tests that were conditional on a specific version of LAPACK
* pointing out in help file of function ICS that the QR algorithm requires LAPACK version >= 3.11.0 to attain better numerical stability

Version 1.4-1

* fixing a mistake in the documentation
* bugfix in summary() method of class ICS so that it doesn't call print()

Version 1.4-0

* changing the maintainer email address and welcoming new contributors to the package

* updating the citation file

Version 1.3-1

* changing the maintainer email address

Version 1.3-0

* improving the code of the ics function
* general revision of the help files
* new functions MeanCov and Mean3Cov4

Version 1.2-5

* changing maintainer email address
* cleaning the depends and imports
* fixing some vignette issues
* some minor code improvements

Version 1.2-4

* changing the test statistic in mvnorm.kur.test to make the test affine invariant, thanks to Sara Taskinen
* dropping the internal check if a matrix is numeric since that is quite time consuming
* some minor code improvements
* changing the maintainer email address

Version 1.2-3

* fixing some problems related to R2.15.0
* updating some help files

Version 1.2-2

* added the function scovq
* updating of references

Version 1.2-1

* added the function cov4.wt
* updating of references

Version 1.2-0

* added a vignette to the package
* changed to the citation. Now the correct citation of the package is a reference to the corresponding JSS paper.

Version 1.1-3:

* The covariance matrix for the mahalabobis distance in mean3 is now devided by n instead of n-1.

Version 1.1-2:

* Fixing a bug in cov4 (reported by Sara Taskinen).

Version 1.1-1:

* Minor changes in documentation.

Version 1.1-0:

* Changing the package title description
* Adding more slots to the ICS class and renaming some
* Giving the option to submit also 2 scatter matrices to the function ics.
  This changes the way of the computation method and leads to a new option on how to
  standardize the Kurtosis values. Note that code for ics of version 1.0-0 might break.
* New function tM
* New function covAxis
* Updating some references
* Some new examples and changing examples so, that X %*% A is now X %*% t(A)

Version 1.0-0:

* First version released on CRAN
